SMIL, the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language, is a W3C recommended XML markup language for describing multimedia presentations.
It defines markup for timing, layout, animations, visual transitions, and media embedding, among other things.
SMIL allows the presentation of media items such as text, images, video, and audio, as well as links to other SMIL presentations,
and files from multiple web servers.
SMIL markup is written in XML, and has similarities to HTML.

"An XML format with a fair amount of overlap with HTML.
Alone among playlist types, SMIL is an open standard, in this case from the W3C.
According to the W3C, SMIL "is typically used for rich media/multimedia presentations which integrate streaming audio and video with images, text or any other media type".
SMIL allows but doesn't define embedded metadata using RDF.
Because of this approach, it has by far the most powerful and flexible metadata support of any playlist format."
