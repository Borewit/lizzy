/**
 * Specifies an URL for a graphic that appears in the display panel of Windows Media Player, beneath the video content.
 * If the media is audio only, the banner graphic is displayed by itself.
 * Windows Media Player reserves a space 32 pixels high by 194 pixels wide (the banner bar) for the graphic.
 * If the graphic defined in the URL is smaller than that, it displays at its original size.
 * If the graphic is larger than the reserved space, Windows Media Player will crop the image to fit the space.
 * <br>
 * A BANNER element defined for an ASX element displays while all clips in the playlist are playing.
 * A BANNER element defined in an ENTRY element displays only while that clip is playing,
 * and during that time overrides any banner defined within the parent ASX element.
 * You can specify how Windows Media Player reserves space for the banner by setting the BANNERBAR attribute of the ASX element.
 * <br>
 * Banner images are not supported with DRM files or when Windows Media Player is embedded in a Web page.
 * <br>
 * Not supported on Windows CE.
