/**
 * Instructs Windows Media Player to submit any log data to the specified URL.
 * <br>
 * The LOGURL element enables a client metafile playlist to send additional logging information to specified servers.
 * Logging information is automatically sent to the origin server of a playlist when it is opened and to each LOGURL specified for the ASX element,
 * if any are present.
 * Logging information is also sent to each LOGURL specified for an ENTRY element when that entry is reached.
 * The URL specified in the HREF attribute of a LOGURL element must be the address of a host that is able to process logging requests.
 * The URL can be any valid HTTP URL.
 * The URL can also indicate the location of a CGI script.
 * <br>
 * The only valid protocols for a LOGURL element are HTTP and HTTPS.
 * <br>
 * A LOGURL element within the scope of an ASX element is applicable only to the metafile in which it resides,
 * regardless of whether that metafile is referenced from another metafile.
 * A LOGURL element forces the submission of log data for all content streamed from within its defined scope
 * and only for content streamed from within its defined scope.
 * Log data will be submitted to the origin server and to all URLs listed in every LOGURL element in scope.
 * Log data will be submitted only once to each listed URL, even if the same URL is listed more than once in a given scope.
 * A repeat of an ENTRY would result in another submission to the listed URLs.
 * <br>
 * There is no limit to the number of LOGURL elements in a metafile playlist.
 * <br>
 * Not supported on Windows CE.
