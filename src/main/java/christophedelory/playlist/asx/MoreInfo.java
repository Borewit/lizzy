 * Specifies an URL for a Web site, e-mail address, or script command associated with a show, clip, or banner.
 * The user can access the target of the URL by clicking on the graphic or text associated with the MOREINFO element.
 * The details depend on the parent element of the MOREINFO element:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the HREF parameter specifies a URL to a Web site, the browser opens and navigates to the URL.</li>
 * <li>If the HREF attribute specifies an e-mail address, the user's e-mail application starts.</li>
 * <li>If the HREF attribute specifies a script command, the script command executes in the browser.</li>
 * </ul>
 * If the MOREINFO element appears within an ASX or ENTRY element, when the mouse cursor is held over the title of the show (for an ASX element)
 * or clip (for an ENTRY element), the URL defined in the HREF attribute can be selected and accessed by Windows Media Player.
