package christophedelory.playlist.asx;

/**
 * Specifies a URL to an embedded skin.
 * This is an URL for a compressed border file with a file extension .wmz.
 * For Windows Media Player 9 Series or later, this value can reference only border files on the user's hard disk
 * located in the same directory as the metafile playlist.
 * <br>
 * It is used to create a border, which is similar to a skin but is displayed in the Now Playing area of the full mode Windows Media Player.
 * It is used only for borders, which appear inside the full mode Windows Media Player, and not for regular skins,
 * which entirely replace the compact mode Windows Media Player.
 * <br>
 * In a Windows Media Download Package (with a .wmd file name extension), the SKIN element enables a border to have content and link to other sites.
 * The Windows Media Download Package is a compressed file that contains a border file and a Windows Media metafile.
 * The border file (with a .wmz file name extension) is compressed, and includes a skin definition file (with a .wms file name extension).
 * <br>
 * A SKIN element has three components:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A skin</li>
 * <li>Some content</li>
 * <li>A metafile</li>
 * </ul>
 * Skins included with Windows Media Download Packages must be rectangular in shape.
 * Creating borders with skins that are not rectangular may yield unexpected results.
 * <br>
 * Windows Media Player version 7.0 or later.
